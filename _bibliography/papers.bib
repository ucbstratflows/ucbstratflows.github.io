  abstract = {We investigate numerically transient linear growth of three-dimensional perturbations in a stratified shear layer to determine which perturbations optimize the growth of the total kinetic and potential energy over a range of finite target time intervals. The stratified shear layer has an initial parallel hyperbolic tangent velocity distribution with Reynolds number Re = U₀h/ν = 1000 and Prandtl number ν/κ = 1, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and κ is the diffusivity of the density. The initial stable buoyancy distribution has constant buoyancy frequency N0, and we consider a range of flows with different bulk Richardson number $Ri_b$ = N₀²h²/U₀²₀, which also corresponds to the minimum gradient Richardson number Rig(z) = N₀2/(dU/dz)2 at the midpoint of the shear layer. For short target times, the optimal perturbations are inherently three-dimensional, while for sufficiently long target times and small Rib the optimal perturbations are closely related to the normal-mode 'Kelvin-Helmholtz' (KH) instability, consistent with analogous calculations in an unstratified mixing layer recently reported by Arratia et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 717, 2013, pp. 90–133). However, we demonstrate that non-trivial transient growth occurs even when the Richardson number is sufficiently high to stabilize all normal-mode instabilities, with the optimal perturbation exciting internal waves at some distance from the midpoint of the shear layer.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have considered the flow of a rectilinear, high Reynolds number, Boussinesq gravity current through a two-layer stratified ambient, however, far less is known concerning the analogue axisymmetric problem. Whereas in both instances there is the possibility of a dynamic coupling between the gravity current front and the waves that are excited by its forward advance, axisymmetric gravity currents entail the added complexity of a radially-diverging flow. Because a steady-state formulation cannot then be developed, we instead present a one-layer shallow water model that describes the flow evolution for various initial conditions and ambient stratifications. We also report upon >30 full- and partial-depth lock release laboratory experiments that span a densitometric range 0 ≤ S < 0.8868 where S = (ρ1 − ρ2)/(ρc − ρ2) in which ρc, ρ1 and ρ2 denote, respectively, the densities of the gravity current and lower and upper ambient layers. Of principal interest is the initial front speed of the gravity current for which good agreement is observed between laboratory measurement and shallow water numerical simulation, despite the limiting assumptions of the latter. The horizontal distance over which the initial front speed is maintained may span several lock-lengths, however, this depends on whether or not the gravity current is substantially impacted by the interfacial wave(s). For example, when the lower ambient layer is moderate and S is large, the transfer of momentum from the gravity current front to the wave may lead to a deceleration so severe that gravity current fluid is swept in the −r direction. The connection between our analysis and problems of pollution dispersion is briefly outlined.},

  abstract = {The Miles-Howard theorem states that a necessary condition for normal-mode instability in parallel, inviscid, steady stratified shear flows is that the minimum gradient Richardson number, Rig,min, is less than 1/4 somewhere in the flow. However, the non-normality of the Navier-Stokes and buoyancy equations may allow for substantial perturbation energy growth at finite times. We calculate numerically the linear optimal perturbations which maximize the perturbation energy gain for a stably stratified shear layer consisting of a hyperbolic tangent velocity distribution with characteristic velocity U₀* and a uniform stratification with constant buoyancy frequency N*. We vary the bulk Richardson number Rib =N*²h*²/U*² (corresponding to Rig,min) between 0.20 and 0.50 and the Reynolds numbers Re = U₀*h*/ν* between 1000 and 8000, with the Prandtl number held fixed at Pr = 1. We find the transient growth of non-normal perturbations may be sufficient to trigger strongly nonlinear effects and breakdown into small-scale structures, thereby leading to enhanced dissipation and non-trivial modification of the background flow even in flows where Rig,min > 1/4. We show that the effects of nonlinearity are more significant for flows with higher Re, lower Rib and higher initial perturbation amplitude E₀ₚ. Enhanced kinetic energy dissipation is observed for higher-Re and lower-Rib flows, and the mixing efficiency, quantified here by εₚ/(εₚ + εₖ) where εₚ is the dissipation rate of density variance and εₖ is the dissipation rate of kinetic energy, is found to be approximately 0.35 for the most strongly nonlinear cases.},

  abstract = {Turbulent mixing of heat and momentum in the stably-stratified ocean interior occurs in discrete events driven by vertical variations of the horizontal velocity. Typically, these events have been modelled assuming an initially laminar stratified shear flow which develops wavelike instabilities, becomes fully turbulent, and then relaminarizes into a stable state. However, in the real ocean there is always some level of turbulence left over from previous events. Using direct numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of a stably-stratified shear layer may be significantly modified by pre-existing turbulence. The classical billow structure associated with Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is suppressed and eventually eliminated as the strength of the initial turbulence is increased. A corresponding energetics analysis shows that potential energy changes and dissipation of kinetic energy depend non-monotonically on initial turbulence strength, with the largest effects when initial turbulence is present but insufficient to prevent billow formation. The mixing efficiency decreases with increasing initial turbulence amplitude as the development of the Kelvin–Helmholtz billow, with its large pre-turbulent mixing efficiency, is arrested.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
