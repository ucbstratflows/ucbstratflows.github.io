Dr. Alexis Kaminski has been an assistant professor in the [department of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley](https://me.berkeley.edu), and the PI of the Stratified Flows group, since January 2021. She received her BSc and MSc in [Mechanical Engineering from the University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/mechanical-engineering/index.html), and her PhD in [Applied Mathematics & Theoretical Physics from the University of Cambridge](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk) (where she was a member of [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk)). Before starting at Cal, she did her postdocs in the Ocean Mixing group in [CEOAS, Oregon State University](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu) and in the Ocean Physics department at the [UW Applied Physics Laboratory](https://apl.uw.edu). She is also a long-time participant in the [WHOI GFD program](https://gfd.whoi.edu). 

Alexis's research focuses on geophysical and environmental fluid mechanics. In particular, she is interested in stratified and buoyancy-driven flows: waves, instabilities, turbulence, and mixing. She approaches these problems using a mixture of numerical simulations, theory, and comparison with observations.
