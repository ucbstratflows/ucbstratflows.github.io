I am interested in understanding and modeling fundamental aspects of multiscale environmental flows whose dynamics are controlled by buoyancy. Guided by a combination of theory, observations and numerical simulations, my work is focused on flows in the ocean interior. In particular, I think about the dynamics of internal waves, stratified flow instabilities and turbulence, which exist at the smallest scales of ocean motion and play a crucial role in the mixing of heat, salt, nutrients and anthropogenic carbon. For example, some of my current work uses data from observations of breaking internal solitary waves on the California inner shelf together with results from theory and numerics to develop improved mixing models. Before starting my postdoc in Berkeley, I was a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, graduating in July 2023. Outside of the academic world, youâ€™re most likely to find me on a bike or cooking dinner.
