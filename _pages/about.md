Welcome to the stratified flows group at UC Berkeley! 

A lot of flows in the ocean and atmosphere around us are *stratified* or *buoyancy-driven* -- that is, they are strongly affected by differences in density (because of heat and salt, for example). In our group, we study the fluid dynamics of these types of flows: how do they become unstable? what types of waves are present? what makes them become turbulent, and how much mixing and entrainment happens as a result? These questions are important in a lot of real-world processes, for example ocean mixing. In general, we study these problems using a mixture of numerical simulations, theory, and comparison with observational measurements. 

We are part of the [fluids/ocean research area in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley](https://me.berkeley.edu/research-areas-and-major-fields/fluids/), and we are part of the broader [Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology group](https://ucb-efmh.github.io/efmh-site/index) (together with other researchers based mostly in civil & environmental engineering).
