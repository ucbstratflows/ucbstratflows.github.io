Vincent is interested in computational fluid dynamics, with particular focus on environmental applications. His research explores the effect of stratified shear instabilities on turbulent mixing of reactive scalars in the upper ocean. He earned his Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Houston where he conducted numerical research on momentum transport in turbulent flows. In his free time, Vincent enjoys hiking, biking, and reading sci-fi.
